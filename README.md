# OscillatingAirfoilSim

OscillatingAirfoilSim is a physics-based simulation framework for
time-domain analysis of oscillating airfoils in unsteady flow regimes.
The solver implements quasi-steady aerodynamic formulations to evaluate
lift, drag, power consumption, and efficiency under prescribed pitching
and plunging kinematics.

The FastAPI backend exposes a parameterized simulation engine, while a
browser-based client renders multi-panel diagnostics for rapid
exploration of dynamic aerodynamic behavior.

**Live demo:** [BumbleBeeSim.onrender.com](https://bumblebeesim.onrender.com)  
**Stack:** FastAPI · NumPy · Matplotlib · Vanilla JS · Render

## Key capabilities
- Returns full oscillation-cycle histories for lift, drag, power, and efficiency in a single API call.
- Web interface supports both single-run analyses and structured pitch and frequency sweeps.
- Solver implements standard quasi-steady unsteady-airfoil formulations
  (Dickinson; Sane & Dickinson; Hoerner; Theodorsen) for rapid evaluation
  without resorting to CFD.
- Server-rendered Matplotlib panels ensure consistent visualization across deployments.

## Quick start
1. **Install requirements**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Run the API + UI**
   ```bash
   uvicorn api:app --reload
   ```
3. Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to access the interface.

> The desktop client (`run_simulation.py`) remains helpful for exploratory sweeps or regression plots outside the web stack.

## Browser controls
| Input | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Frequency (Hz) | Primary oscillation frequency applied to plunge and pitch motion. |
| Pitch (deg) | Peak pitch amplitude; converted to radians prior to integration. |
| Sweep step | Increment for the ±2 step sweep around the selected base value. |
| Simulation length (s) | Total simulated duration; temporal resolution (`dt`) is set server-side. |

Available actions:
- **Run Single Simulation** – evaluates one parameter set.
- **Run Pitch Sweep** – changed pitch amplitude about the baseline using ±step and ±2·step.
- **Run Frequency Sweep** – changes oscillation frequency in the same fashion.

## Physics model
The airfoil is modeled as a rigid flat plate undergoing prescribed
sinusoidal plunge and pitch motion with multiple configurable parameters
when ran locally.

Aerodynamic forces are computed using quasi-steady aerodynamic model
with contributions from translational lift, rotational lift,
and added-mass effects.

- **Lift**  
  `L = L_trans + L_rot + L_added_mass`
- **Drag**  
  `D = 0.5 * ρ * S * U² * C_D`
- **Power**  
  `P = aerodynamic work from translation, rotation, and added mass`
- **Efficiency**  
  `η = (L · U) / P`

Model coefficients governing dynamic pressure corrections, rotational
lift augmentation, and added-mass response are consistent with
established unsteady-airfoil and bio-inspired flight literature.

## Default reference configuration

The default parameters correspond to a small-scale, low-Reynolds-number
reference case representative of bio-inspired flight regimes.

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Air density (ρ) | 1.225 kg/m³ |
| Wing area (S) | 2e-4 m² |
| Chord length (c) | 4 mm |
| Frequency (f) | 150 Hz |
| Stroke amplitude | 0.01 m |
| Pitch amplitude | 45° |
| Phase offset | 180° |
| CL<sub>α</sub> | 2π |
| CD₀ | 0.1 |
| CD<sub>α</sub> | 1.5 |
| Added-mass coefficient | 0.05 |

Modify `run_simulation.base_params` or provide new values to the API to approximate other species or experimental setups.

## API surface
| Endpoint | Payload | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /simulate_plot` | `{ f, pitch_amp (rad), t_end }` | Returns base64 PNG containing six subplots. |
| `POST /sweep_steps` | `{ sweep_type, base, freq_hz, pitch_deg, step, t_end }` | Sweep either pitch or frequency around `base`; delivers multi-series plots. |
| `GET /` | – | Serves the front-end (`static/index.html`). |

`fig_to_base64` handles server-side PNG conversion so the client updates plots by swapping the `<img>` source.

---

## Testing
```
pytest
```
`test_simulation.py` verifies the solver remains finite and that array lengths stay synchronized; augment with regression baselines before major refactors.
